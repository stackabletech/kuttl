KUbernetes Test TooL (KUTTL) provides a declarative approach to test Kubernetes Operators.

KUTTL is designed for testing operators, however it can declaratively test any kubernetes objects.

```
curl -Lo kuttl "https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/packages/kuttl/stable-{$(arch)}"
sudo mv kuttl /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kuttl
```

Or install it from source:
```
go install github.com/stackabletech/kuttl/cmd/kubectl-kuttl@latest
